Clean up Print Flyer - remove QR code and fix decorative squares.

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## Issue 1: Remove QR Code

The QR code placeholder looks rough and unfinished. Remove it entirely for now.

Delete the QR code drawing code:
- Remove the "Scan for listing" text
- Remove the QR code placeholder squares

We can add a proper QR code generator in a future update.

## Issue 2: Fix or Remove Decorative Squares

The black/white checkered squares around the agent photo look messy and don't match the template properly.

Option A (Recommended): Remove them entirely for cleaner look
- Delete the decorative squares drawing code
- Keep the agent section clean and simple

Option B: If keeping, make them subtle
- Position them better (only in corner, not overlapping agent photo)
- Make them smaller and more refined
- Match the template placement exactly

For MVP, let's go with Option A - remove the decorative squares for a cleaner professional look.

## Issue 3: Reduce Remaining White Space

There's still too much white space at the bottom of the flyer.

Options to fix:
1. Move the entire bottom section down slightly
2. Add more vertical spacing between elements in the info section
3. Increase font sizes slightly
4. Or add a subtle footer element

## Issue 4: Agent Name Capitalization

Current: "daryl camingao" (lowercase)
Should be: "Daryl Camingao" (Title Case)

Apply proper capitalization to agent name:
```javascript
function toTitleCase(str) {
  return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, (txt) => 
    txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase()
  );
}
```

## Updated Agent Section Layout (Clean Version)

After removing QR and decorative squares:
[Agent Photo - circular, 180px]
Agent Name (Title Case, bold)
REALTOR®
Phone Number
[Spyglass Logo - small]

Centered vertically and horizontally in the right column.
