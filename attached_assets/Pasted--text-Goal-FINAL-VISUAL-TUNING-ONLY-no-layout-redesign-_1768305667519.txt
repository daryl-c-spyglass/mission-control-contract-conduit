Goal: FINAL VISUAL TUNING ONLY (no layout redesign). The flyer is structurally correct now. What’s left is visual tuning:
1) slightly less white space at the bottom
2) slightly larger agent avatar + Spyglass logo (bottom-right)
3) slightly softer listing headline (NOT bold)

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: PREVIEW MUST ALWAYS MATCH DOWNLOAD (pixel-identical)
This is non-negotiable. The “Preview” thumbnail/preview panel must be the exact same render as “Download Flyer”.

1) Single source of truth for rendering
- There must be ONE render pipeline/function for the print flyer (HTML/CSS → Puppeteer → PNG/PDF).
- Preview and Download must call the SAME function, using the SAME template, SAME CSS, SAME assets, SAME fonts, SAME viewport, SAME scale/DPI, SAME background, SAME margins, SAME image URLs, SAME cache-busting, SAME everything.
- Do NOT maintain separate templates/styles for preview vs download.
- If you currently have separate endpoints/routes (e.g., /preview and /download), both must call the SAME renderFlyer(payload, options) function with identical options.

2) Make preview output identical to download output
- Preview should render at the exact print size (8.5x11) using the same dimensions/resolution as download.
  Example target: 2550x3300 @300dpi (or whatever your download uses). Preview can display a scaled-down version in UI, but the source image must be the same.
- In UI: show the scaled-down image via CSS (max-width / height auto). Do NOT re-render at a different size for preview.
- Ensure the same font loading path for both:
  - Wait for fonts to load before screenshot/PDF: `await page.evaluate(() => document.fonts.ready)` (or equivalent).
  - Use the same local font files and CSS @font-face for both preview and download.
- Ensure consistent image rendering:
  - Use identical photo URLs and transformations for both preview and download.
  - If using signed URLs or temporary URLs, ensure preview and download request the same resolved assets.
- Ensure Puppeteer settings are identical:
  - Same `deviceScaleFactor`, same `printBackground`, same `preferCSSPageSize`, same `clip` logic if used.
  - If download uses PDF then converts to PNG, preview must use the same approach OR both should use direct screenshot from the same page.
  - Avoid different paths like “preview uses screenshot” and “download uses PDF print” unless they produce identical outputs. Prefer using the same method.

3) Add verification test so this never regresses
- Add a quick automated check:
  - Given the same payload, render PREVIEW PNG and DOWNLOAD PNG.
  - Assert dimensions are identical.
  - Assert either the hashes match OR run a small pixel-diff with a very low tolerance (only metadata differences allowed).
  - Fail the build / log a clear error if they differ.

A) Reduce bottom white space (without changing the structure)
- The bottom band (stats + headline/description + agent block) should “anchor” closer to the bottom edge.
- Adjust spacing by:
  - Reduce the vertical gap between the 2-photo row and the bottom band by ~16–24px (or equivalent in your CSS).
  - Optionally reduce padding-bottom within the page container if it exists, but net effect must be: less blank space BELOW the bottom band.
- Do NOT stretch the whole page or change image cropping; only tighten vertical spacing/margins/padding so the content fills the page better.

B) Increase agent avatar + Spyglass logo sizes (bottom-right)
- Increase the agent avatar diameter by +15–20% from current.
- Increase the avatar border thickness proportionally (example: if border is 1px now, go to 2px; keep same border color).
- Increase Spyglass logo size by +15–20% from current.
- Keep the agent block aligned (no overlap):
  - Agent name, title, phone remain vertically stacked under each other.
  - The avatar and logo must still fit in the agent column without clipping.
  - If needed, slightly tighten vertical padding inside the agent block (a few px) to make room.

C) Make listing headline “softer” (explicitly not bold)
- Force listing headline font-weight to 400 (normal).
- If it still reads too heavy, reduce font-size by 1–2px OR reduce letter-spacing slightly.
- Ensure phone number is also NOT bold.
- The description remains left-aligned (keep as-is).

D) Guardrails / don’ts
- Do NOT introduce horizontal (X-axis) divider lines.
- Do NOT change the divider concept; keep vertical (Y-axis) separators only.
- Do NOT change the photo layout/cropping logic besides the small spacing tightening mentioned above.

E) Acceptance checklist (must verify before marking done)
1) Preview PNG == Download PNG for same inputs (pixel-identical; same dimensions; hash match or near-zero pixel-diff).
2) Bottom white space reduced: bottom band sits visibly closer to the bottom edge (no huge blank area).
3) Avatar + logo are visibly larger (15–20%) and not clipped/overlapping.
4) Listing headline is clearly NOT bold (font-weight 400), and phone number is NOT bold.
5) No new horizontal divider lines were added.
6) Show before/after outputs for the same listing to confirm.

Implement these changes, regenerate a sample flyer, and provide the updated output PNGs for review.
