We are matching the Spyglass flyer layout (8.5x11 @ 300DPI, 2550x3300). The flyer is now close; final fixes are:

CRITICAL RULE: Preview MUST always mirror Download Flyer 1:1.
- There must be a single rendering pipeline and identical HTML/CSS for preview PNG and download PNG/PDF.
- The Preview button should call the same backend render used for Download, and display THAT returned PNG (not a separate “preview-only” HTML, not different CSS, not a scaled/alternate template).
- If there are separate endpoints/functions for preview vs download, refactor so both routes call the same render function with the same template and same viewport settings.
- Ensure Puppeteer uses the same: page.setViewport, deviceScaleFactor, and the same HTML input for both preview + download.

ASSETS (use these exact icons):
- /mnt/data/Bedroom.png
- /mnt/data/Bathroom.png
- /mnt/data/sq ft.png

Step 1 — Replace current stat icons with the provided PNG icons:
- In server/templates/flyer-template.html, update the stats icon markup so it uses <img> tags pointing to these icon assets.
- Make them render reliably in Puppeteer:
  Option A (preferred): copy icons into a static path (e.g. server/public/icons/bedroom.png, bathroom.png, sqft.png) and reference with absolute path in template (/icons/bedroom.png etc).
  Option B: inline them as base64 data URIs in the HTML template so there is zero path risk.
- Icon sizing: ~44–54px square (finalize so text sits on one line).
- The stat row must be ONE LINE: [icon] [NUMBER + label], e.g. “4 bedrooms”, “2 bathrooms”, “1,850 sq. ft”.
- Use flex row with gap ~16–20px; vertically center icon + text.

Step 2 — Fix LEFT STATS vertical position (move slightly downward) and align to agent phone baseline:
Goal: the bottom of the stats block visually aligns on the same horizontal baseline as the agent phone number (your latest screenshot: sqft is already close; move the whole stats group down slightly so bedrooms/bathrooms don’t sit too high).
- Implement by adding a small top offset ONLY to the stats column content (not the whole bottom section):
  e.g. .stats-column { padding-top: 18px; } (tune 12–28px as needed)
- Do NOT change the overall page height math.
- Keep the stats column aligned to the same vertical band as the agent info and description.

Step 3 — Divider behavior: Y-axis ONLY, height must match content band (NOT the whole remaining white area)
We only want vertical dividers (Y axis). No horizontal “x-axis” rules anywhere in the bottom band.
- The left vertical divider (between stats and description) must start/stop aligned with the text band:
  Start near the first stat line and end near the last stat line (or aligned to the agent phone line if that’s the common baseline).
- The right vertical divider (between description and agent) must also only span the content band: roughly from listing headline area down to phone baseline.
- Do NOT allow dividers to stretch to full column height.
Implementation requirement:
- Do NOT use border-left on full-height grid columns.
- Instead, render dividers as pseudo-elements or dedicated divider elements whose height is tied to content:
  Example approach:
  - Wrap the bottom content in a “bottom-inner” band with display:flex and align-items:flex-start.
  - Insert divider elements as their own nodes: <div class="v-divider"></div>
  - Give .v-divider a fixed height driven by CSS variable or by content measurement (preferred: tie to the tallest content block height in that band).
  - If you keep CSS Grid, create a nested wrapper in each column and place the divider as absolute-positioned with top/bottom based on padding variables (NOT bottom:0).

Step 4 — Remove any accidental x-axis lines
In the current output there is sometimes a faint horizontal rule appearing (especially near the bottom of the stats area).
- Ensure NO border-top / border-bottom rules exist for the bottom band, stats items, description wrapper, or agent wrapper.
- Only vertical dividers should remain.

Step 5 — Listing headline + description alignment rules (match reference)
- Headline is centered in its column.
- Description is LEFT aligned (not centered), and the description block should visually align with the left edge of the text area.
- Keep typography consistent with our existing fonts, but do not introduce bolding where not intended.

Step 6 — Acceptance checklist (must pass BEFORE merge)
Create a quick local checklist and verify each with real renders:
A) Preview == Download
  - Render Preview PNG and Download PNG for the same listing and compare pixel-diff (or visually confirm they are identical).
  - Ensure the same template HTML/CSS is used.
B) Icons
  - Bedroom/Bathroom/Sqft use the provided PNG icons (not old SVG placeholders).
  - Each stat row is single-line with icon and text aligned.
C) Stats position
  - Stats group nudged slightly downward so bedrooms/bathrooms visually align better with the agent phone baseline (sqft already close).
D) Dividers
  - Only Y-axis vertical dividers exist.
  - Divider heights stop at the content band (do not run into the big white space).
  - No divider overlaps any text or photos.
E) No horizontal rules
  - Confirm there are zero x-axis lines in the bottom section.
F) No page height break
  - Flyer remains exactly 2550x3300 and does not introduce extra whitespace shifts.

After changes, generate:
- one Preview render
- one Download render
and confirm they match exactly and the dividers/icons/alignments match the reference behavior.
