Implement smart photo auto-selection for flyers using Repliers Image Insights.

Files to modify:
- server/repliers.ts
- client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## Part 1: Create Photo Selection Utility (Server)

Add a utility function in server/repliers.ts:

1. Create function: selectBestPhotosForFlyer(imageInsights, images, count = 3)

2. Selection priority for Print Flyer (3 photos):
   - Photo 1 (Hero): "Front of Structure" OR "Back of Structure" OR first exterior
     - Highest prediction confidence (>= 0.90)
     - Tie-breaker: highest quality.quantitative score
   - Photo 2: "Kitchen"
     - Highest prediction confidence (>= 0.90)
     - Tie-breaker: highest quality.quantitative score
   - Photo 3: "Living Room" OR "Family Room" OR "Dining Room"
     - Highest prediction confidence (>= 0.90)
     - Tie-breaker: highest quality.quantitative score

3. Fallback logic:
   - If category not found, pick next best available room type
   - If no imageInsights, return first N images from images array
   - Always ensure we return the requested count (or all if fewer available)

4. Return structure:
   {
     selectedPhotos: [
       { url: "https://cdn.repliers.io/...", classification: "Front of Structure", quality: 4.5, confidence: 0.95 },
       { url: "https://cdn.repliers.io/...", classification: "Kitchen", quality: 4.2, confidence: 0.99 },
       { url: "https://cdn.repliers.io/...", classification: "Living Room", quality: 4.0, confidence: 0.98 }
     ],
     hasImageInsights: true,
     selectionMethod: "ai" | "fallback"
   }

## Part 2: Add API Endpoint for Smart Selection

Create endpoint: GET /api/listings/:mlsNumber/best-photos

1. Fetches listing with imageInsights
2. Calls selectBestPhotosForFlyer()
3. Returns the selected photos with metadata

## Part 3: Update Create Flyer Dialog

In create-flyer-dialog.tsx:

1. Add "Auto-Select Best Photos" button (with sparkle icon ✨)
   - Position: Above the photo grid
   - Text: "✨ Auto-Select Best Photos"
   - Only show when Print Flyer format is selected

2. On click:
   - Call /api/listings/:mlsNumber/best-photos
   - Auto-select the returned photos in the grid
   - Show toast: "Selected: Exterior, Kitchen, Living Room" (or actual room types)

3. Show badges on auto-selected photos:
   - Small label showing room type: "Kitchen", "Exterior", etc.
   - Quality indicator (star rating or "Excellent" badge)

4. Keep manual selection available:
   - Agent can still click to change selections
   - "Auto-Select" just provides smart defaults

## Part 4: Update Photo Grid UI

1. Add room type badges to ALL photo thumbnails (not just selected):
   - Small overlay label at bottom: "Kitchen", "Living Room", etc.
   - Subtle, doesn't block the photo

2. Add quality indicator (optional):
   - Small star icon with quality score
   - Or color-coded border (green = excellent, yellow = above average)

3. Add filter/sort options (optional):
   - "Sort by: Quality" dropdown
   - "Filter by: Room Type" dropdown

## Part 5: Clean Up Debug Endpoint

Remove the temporary diagnostic endpoint:
- DELETE /api/debug/check-image-insights/:mlsNumber

Test by:
1. Open Create Flyer dialog (Print Flyer format)
2. Click "Auto-Select Best Photos"
3. Verify it selects Exterior + Kitchen + Living Room
4. Verify room type badges appear on thumbnails
5. Verify agent can still manually change selection
6. Generate flyer and confirm selected photos appear correctly
