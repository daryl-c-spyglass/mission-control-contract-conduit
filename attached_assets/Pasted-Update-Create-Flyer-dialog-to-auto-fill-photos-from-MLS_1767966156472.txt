Update Create Flyer dialog to auto-fill photos from MLS data.

Files to modify:
- client/src/components/transaction-details.tsx (pass MLS photos to dialog)
- client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx (use MLS photos)

## Part 1: Pass MLS photos to CreateFlyerDialog

In transaction-details.tsx, update the CreateFlyerDialog usage (around line 445-449):

1. Pass the MLS images array as a prop:
   - mlsPhotos={mlsData?.images || []}

2. Ensure mlsData is available when the dialog opens

## Part 2: Update CreateFlyerDialog to use MLS photos

In create-flyer-dialog.tsx:

1. Add new prop to interface:
   - mlsPhotos?: string[]

2. Add state to track selected photos:
   - selectedPhotos: string[] (max 3 photos for flyer)

3. Update the photo selection UI:
   - Show MLS photos in a scrollable grid (thumbnails)
   - User can click to select/deselect (max 3)
   - Selected photos show a checkmark or border highlight
   - Display selected count: "3/3 photos selected"
   - Keep the manual upload option as fallback ("Or upload your own")

4. Photo selection grid layout:
   - 4 columns of thumbnails
   - Each thumbnail ~80x80px
   - Checkbox overlay or selection indicator
   - Show total available: "23 photos available from MLS"

5. When generating flyer:
   - Use selectedPhotos array instead of manually uploaded files
   - If selectedPhotos is empty, fall back to uploaded files
   - Main photo = selectedPhotos[0]
   - Secondary photos = selectedPhotos[1], selectedPhotos[2]

6. Default behavior:
   - Auto-select first 3 MLS photos when dialog opens (if available)
   - User can change selection before generating

## Part 3: Update the flyer canvas generation

Modify the canvas drawing code to:
- Load images from URLs (MLS photos) instead of File objects
- Handle async image loading properly
- Show loading state while images load

Test by:
1. Open a transaction with MLS photos
2. Click "Create Flyer"
3. Verify MLS photos appear in selection grid
4. Verify first 3 are pre-selected
5. Generate flyer and confirm photos appear in output
