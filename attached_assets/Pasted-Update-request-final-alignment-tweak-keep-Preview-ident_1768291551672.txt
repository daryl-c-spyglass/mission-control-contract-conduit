Update request: final alignment tweak + keep Preview identical to Download

Context:
- Flyer template: server/templates/flyer-template.html
- Renderer: server/services/flyer-generator.ts
- Client preview: create-flyer-dialog.tsx

Goal (1): Move the left “stats” group (bedrooms/bathrooms/sqft) DOWN slightly, without changing:
- current sqft baseline alignment with the agent phone number (this is already correct)
- current divider positions (these are now correct)

Goal (2): Preview must remain identical to Download (no layout drift).

---------------------------------------
A) Stats group vertical shift (down) while keeping sqft baseline aligned to phone
---------------------------------------

Current behavior:
- sqft line is aligned to phone number baseline already (good)
- bedrooms/bathrooms appear slightly too high relative to that baseline
Desired:
- move bedrooms + bathrooms DOWN a bit
- keep sqft exactly where it is (still aligned to phone baseline)

Implementation requirement:
- Do NOT move the entire stats column (that would move sqft too).
- Instead, split stats into two sub-wrappers so only the first two rows move.

Template change (HTML):
Inside the stats column, wrap the first two stat rows in a group:

<div class="stats-column">
  <div class="stats-top">
    <!-- bedrooms row -->
    <!-- bathrooms row -->
  </div>

  <div class="stats-bottom">
    <!-- sqft row -->
  </div>
</div>

CSS change:
- Add a small top margin (or translateY) to .stats-top only.
- Keep .stats-bottom untouched.
- Use px units (we’re in fixed 2550x3300 layout).

Example (tune to match visually):
.stats-top { margin-top: 18px; }  /* or 22px if needed */
.stats-bottom { margin-top: 0; }

Important:
- Do NOT introduce any new horizontal rules.
- Do NOT alter divider heights/positions.
- Ensure stat rows remain one-line with icons.

After this change, re-render and confirm:
- sqft line still aligns with phone number baseline
- bedrooms/bathrooms are slightly lower (more balanced)
- no other layout changes.

---------------------------------------
B) Preview must always match Download
---------------------------------------

Do not change anything that would reintroduce preview/download drift.

Verify:
1) Preview endpoint and Download endpoint use the same template, same CSS, same font loading wait, same media emulation.
2) If we already implemented “single source of truth” rendering (PDF-first then PNG from that PDF), keep it.
3) Add/keep a renderHash log and confirm preview & download for same payload share the same hash.
4) Confirm the preview image shown in the modal is the server-produced PNG (no client-side transforms besides display scaling).

Acceptance test:
- Generate Preview, then Download for the same listing and photos
- They must be visually identical (same placement, same spacing, same dividers, same stats alignment).

Deliverable:
- Commit the HTML wrapper change + CSS adjustment for .stats-top only
- No other layout regressions
- Confirm with screenshot comparison (preview vs download) that they match exactly.
