Analysis: Corrected Column Widths for 720px Fit
This is an inquiry response based on the current code and grid requirements.

Current Code Reality
The current widths in the code DO overflow. Here's the math:

Element	Current Width	Notes
Stats Column	150.72px	Fixed width
Divider 1	4px + 42px margin = 46px	Fixed
Description Column	432px	Fixed width
Divider 2	4px + 21px margin = 25px	Fixed
Agent Card	335px	Fixed width
TOTAL	988.72px	Overflows by 268.72px
Available space: 720px (816px canvas - 48px padding on each side)

Required Widths to Center Photo in Grid 15
For Photo center at 510px and QR center at ~680px:

Working backwards:

Photo is 105.6px wide → Photo left edge at 510 - 52.8 = 457.2px
QR is 73.92px wide, gap 16px → QR left at 457.2 + 105.6 + 16 = 578.8px
QR center at 578.8 + 36.96 = 615.76px (just into Grid 16 ✓)
Agent Card positioning:

Agent Card needs to start so photo lands at 457.2px
With 27px padding + centering offset (~56px), Agent Card starts at ~374px from canvas
From bottom section start (48px): 374 - 48 = 326px
Corrected Widths That Would Fit
Element	Corrected Width	Fits in 720px
Stats Column	110px	✓
Divider 1 (with margins)	30px (4px + 26px margin)	✓
Description Column	186px	✓
Divider 2 (with margins)	20px (4px + 16px margin)	✓
Agent Card	374px	✓
TOTAL	720px	✓
Result Grid Alignment
With corrected widths:

Element	X Start	X End	Grid
Stats	48px	158px	Grid 13
Divider 1	184px	188px	Grid 13/14 border
Description	188px	374px	Grid 14
Divider 2	390px	394px	Grid 14/15 border
Agent Card	394px	768px	Grid 15-16
Photo center	~510px	-	Grid 15 center ✓
QR center	~616px	-	Grid 16 start ✓
Summary
The current code has a bug - the column widths total 988.72px but only 720px is available. The overflow causes the Photo and QR to render outside the visible canvas area.

To fix and achieve Photo in Grid 15 / QR in Grid 16:

Description column needs to shrink from 432px to ~186px
Agent Card can expand slightly to ~374px for proper centering
Divider margins need reduction
