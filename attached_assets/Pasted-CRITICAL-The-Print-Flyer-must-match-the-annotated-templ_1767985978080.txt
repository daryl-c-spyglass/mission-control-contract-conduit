CRITICAL: The Print Flyer must match the annotated template (Ad_Graphics_Square_Annotation_copy.psd) exactly.

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## REFERENCE: Annotated Template Elements

From the annotated PSD, here are ALL required elements:

### HEADER SECTION:
- LEFT: "COMPANY LOGO" - Spyglass Realty logo (large, clear)
- CENTER: "Leading Real Estate Companies of the World" logo (BACKGROUND BLACK area)
- RIGHT: "LISTING PRICE" with "BACKGROUND (GOLD BROWN)" - price badge

### ADDRESS BAR:
- "LISTING ADDRESS" - Full address with letter spacing
- Dark/black background

### PHOTOS:
- "LISTING PHOTO" (main) - Large hero image
- "LISTING PHOTO" x2 - Two secondary photos side by side

### BOTTOM INFO SECTION (Three Columns):

**LEFT COLUMN - Property Stats:**
- "LISTING BEDROOM #" with bed icon
- "LISTING BATHROOM #" with bath icon  
- "LISTING SQFT #" with sqft icon
- "BACKGROUND (ICONS)" - specific icon designs

**CENTER COLUMN - Description:**
- "LISTING HEADLINE (39 CHARACTER MAX)" 
- "LISTING DESCRIPTION (115 CHARACTER MAX)"

**RIGHT COLUMN - Agent Info:**
- "AGENT PHOTO" - circular photo
- "SPACE FOR TEAM LOGO" - Spyglass logo
- "AGENT INFORMATION" - name, title, phone
- "BACKGROUND (BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES)" - decorative element

## FIX 1: Header Must Have Three Elements

Current: Only logo on left, price on right
Template: Logo LEFT + "Leading" CENTER + Price RIGHT

Add back the "Leading Real Estate Companies" in the center:
```javascript
// Header layout (white background)
// LEFT (x: 40): Spyglass logo - MAKE IT LARGER (~200px wide)
// CENTER (x: ~800): "Leading Real Estate Companies of the World" text/logo
// RIGHT (x: ~2100): Price badge
```

For the center "Leading" element, either:
1. Use styled text: "Leading" in script font + "REAL ESTATE COMPANIES OF THE WORLD" below
2. Or just use text styled appropriately

## FIX 2: Make Spyglass Logo Larger and Clearer

Current logo is tiny and unclear. Make it much larger:
- Width: ~200-250px
- Should clearly show the circular arc design + "SPYGLASS REALTY" text
- Use the SpyglassRealty_Logo_Black.png asset

## FIX 3: Description Must Be Complete (No "...")

Current: "The single-story, four bedroom home you've been waiting for! This beautiful move-in ready home is nestled in a..."

This is STILL being cut off! The AI Summarize must generate a COMPLETE sentence under 115 characters.

Fix the AI prompt to STRICTLY enforce:
- Maximum 115 characters
- Must end with complete sentence (period, not "...")
- Never truncate mid-thought

Server-side validation:
```javascript
// After AI generates, verify it's complete
if (summary.endsWith('...') || summary.length > 115) {
  // Regenerate or truncate at last complete sentence
  const lastPeriod = summary.lastIndexOf('.');
  if (lastPeriod > 50) {
    summary = summary.substring(0, lastPeriod + 1);
  }
}
```

## FIX 4: Add Decorative Black/White Squares

The annotated template shows "BACKGROUND (BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES)" around the agent section.

Add these back:
```javascript
// Decorative squares - position near agent photo area
const squareSize = 25;
const startX = agentX + 150; // Right of agent photo
const startY = agentY - 20;

// Draw 3x4 grid of alternating squares
for (let row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
  for (let col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
    ctx.fillStyle = (row + col) % 2 === 0 ? '#000000' : '#FFFFFF';
    ctx.fillRect(
      startX + col * squareSize,
      startY + row * squareSize,
      squareSize,
      squareSize
    );
  }
}
```

Make them subtle and positioned like in the template (corner area near agent).

## FIX 5: Reduce Bottom White Space

Still ~40% of bottom is empty. The content should fill more space:

1. Increase font sizes:
   - Property stats: 48px bold
   - Headline: 36px bold
   - Description: 28px regular
   - Agent name: 42px bold

2. Increase spacing between elements:
   - Gap between each property stat: 80px
   - Gap between headline and description: 30px

3. Move content lower to fill the page

## FIX 6: Icons Must Match Template "BACKGROUND (ICONS)"

The annotated template shows specific icon designs. They should be:

**Bed icon:** Horizontal bed frame with headboard posts
**Bath icon:** Bathtub with faucet and legs
**Sqft icon:** Rectangle with diagonal measurement line

Current icons are too basic (simple rectangles). Need more detailed line drawings.

Test by generating flyer and comparing EVERY element to the annotated template.
