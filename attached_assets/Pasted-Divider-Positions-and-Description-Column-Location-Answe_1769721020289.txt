Divider Positions and Description Column Location
Answer: The Layout Structure
It's Option A: Stats | Divider 1 | Description | Divider 2 | Agent Card (5 columns)

The Description column has content by default:

Headline: "Prime Opportunity in Travis County"
Description: "This beautiful property features an open floor plan, gourmet kitchen, and luxurious finishes throughout..."
Exact X Positions (Current Code at 1.0 Scale = 816×1056)
Bottom section starts at X = 48px (24px left position + 24px from bleed/padding context).

Element	X Start	X End	Width	Grid Location
Stats	48px	198.72px	150.72px	Grid 13 (0-204)
Margin	198.72px	240.72px	42px	-
Divider 1	240.72px	244.72px	4px	Grid 14 (204-408)
Description container	244.72px	676.72px	432px	Grids 14-15
Description text starts	276.72px	-	(after 32px padding)	Grid 14
Margin	676.72px	697.72px	21px	-
Divider 2	697.72px	701.72px	4px	Off canvas!
Agent Card	701.72px	1036.72px	335px	Off canvas!
Why Grid 14 Might Appear Empty
If you're seeing Grid 14 as empty in the preview:

Preview is at 0.65 scale - positions appear compressed

Divider 1 at 240.72px × 0.65 = 156.47px in the preview
This would appear in the left portion of where Grid 14 would be if grid overlay is also scaled
Overflow clipping - The description (432px wide) plus everything after it overflows the container. Some browsers may clip or not render overflowing content correctly.

Text color/visibility - Check if the description text color (#333) is visible against the background.
