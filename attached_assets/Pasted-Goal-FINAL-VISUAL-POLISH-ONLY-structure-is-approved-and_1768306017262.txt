Goal: FINAL VISUAL POLISH ONLY — structure is approved and must not change.

ABSOLUTE RULE: PREVIEW MUST BE PIXEL-IDENTICAL TO DOWNLOAD
- Preview and Download must use the SAME render pipeline, SAME HTML, SAME CSS, SAME Puppeteer config, SAME dimensions, SAME DPI, SAME assets.
- Preview must simply display a scaled-down version of the exact PNG/PDF used for Download.
- No separate preview styles, no conditional CSS, no alternate templates.
- Add a guard check: same input payload must produce identical dimensions and hash (or near-zero pixel diff).

--------------------------------
VISUAL TUNING TASKS
--------------------------------

1) Reduce bottom white space (subtle)
- Reduce vertical padding/margin below the bottom content block (stats + headline/description + agent).
- Target reduction: ~16–24px.
- Do NOT stretch images or change photo cropping.
- The bottom content should sit closer to the page bottom, but never touch it.

2) Increase agent avatar + Spyglass logo size (bottom-right)
- Increase agent avatar diameter by ~15–20%.
- Increase avatar border thickness proportionally (keep same color and style).
- Increase Spyglass logo size by ~15–20%.
- Keep layout intact:
  - No overlap with headline/description.
  - Agent name, title, and phone remain vertically stacked and readable.
- If needed, slightly reduce internal padding within the agent block to compensate.

3) Soften listing headline further (NOT bold)
- Force font-weight: 400 (normal).
- Slightly soften appearance by ONE of the following:
  - Reduce font-size by 1–2px OR
  - Slightly reduce letter-spacing.
- Headline must remain clear and prominent, but not heavy.
- Phone number must remain NOT bold.

4) Maintain alignment discipline
- Keep vertical (Y-axis) dividers only — no horizontal divider lines.
- Stats (beds/baths/sq ft), description, and agent block must remain visually aligned across the same horizontal band.
- No new layout shifts or column changes.

--------------------------------
DO NOT CHANGE
--------------------------------
- Photo layout, image count, or crop logic.
- Divider positions (only length may implicitly change due to spacing adjustments).
- Font families or brand colors.
- Overall section order.

--------------------------------
ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
--------------------------------
- Preview PNG == Download PNG (pixel-identical).
- Bottom white space visibly reduced but still breathable.
- Agent avatar and Spyglass logo clearly larger and better balanced.
- Headline is clearly NOT bold and visually softer.
- No overlaps, no new dividers, no layout regressions.

After implementing, regenerate one sample flyer and confirm Preview and Download outputs match exactly.
