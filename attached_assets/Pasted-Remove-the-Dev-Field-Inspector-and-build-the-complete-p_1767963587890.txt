Remove the Dev Field Inspector and build the complete property detail view using confirmed Repliers field paths.

Files to modify:
- client/src/components/transaction-details.tsx

## Part 1: Remove Dev Inspector
- Remove the "Dev: Field Inspector" section and "Hide Raw Data" button
- Remove any debug console.logs added for field inspection
- Keep the core MLS data functionality

## Part 2: Build Photo Gallery (MLS Data Tab)

Add a photo gallery section at the top of the MLS Data tab using these confirmed fields:
- Photos: `mlsData.images` (Array of image URLs)
- Photo count: `mlsData.images.length`

Layout:
- Large main photo on left (~60% width) with left/right arrow navigation
- Thumbnail grid on right (2 columns x 3 rows, showing first 6 photos)
- Last thumbnail shows overlay "See all X photos" (X = images.length)
- Clicking thumbnail sets it as main photo
- Clicking arrows cycles through all photos

## Part 3: Browse by Room Type Section

Using the `rooms` array (Array of 9 items), create filterable tabs:
- Check if rooms array contains categorized data
- If rooms have type/name fields, create filter tabs (All, Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom, Bathroom, etc.)
- If rooms don't have photo associations, skip this section for now

## Part 4: Feature Tags Row

Display property features as pill/tag buttons using:
- View: `mlsData.details.viewType` (only show if not "None")
- Garage: `mlsData.details.garage` + " Car Garage"
- Patio: `mlsData.details.patio`
- Also check `mlsData.details.extras` for additional features

Style: horizontal row of rounded pills with icons (similar to reference screenshots)

## Part 5: About This Home Section

- Header: "About This Home"
- Content: `mlsData.details.description`
- Full text, no truncation

## Part 6: Property Details Grid (2 columns)

| Left Column | Right Column |
|-------------|--------------|
| MLS #: `mlsNumber` | Status: `standardStatus` |
| Property Type: `propertyType` | Year Built: `yearBuilt` |
| Listed Date: from `timestamps` | Days on Market: `daysOnMarket` |
| Elementary School: if available | Middle School: if available |
| High School: if available | Subdivision: if available |

## Part 7: Location Map Section

Add Google Maps embed at the bottom:
- Header: "Location"
- Use coordinates: `mlsData.latitude`, `mlsData.longitude`
- Map height: 300px
- API key from environment: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- Show property marker on map

## Part 8: Keep Existing Sidebar

Preserve the right sidebar with:
- Status badge + Days on Market
- Price (large, formatted)
- Price per sqft
- Property Overview (Beds, Baths, Sq Ft, Lot, Year Built, Stories)
- Financial Details (Annual Taxes from `taxes.annualAmount`)
- Listing Information (MLS#, List Date, Property Type, Style, Agent, Office)

## Technical Notes
- Use the confirmed field paths exactly as listed above
- Handle missing fields gracefully (don't show section if data is null/undefined)
- Maintain dark theme styling consistent with existing app
- Make photo gallery responsive

Test by viewing a transaction's MLS Data tab - photos should now display with full gallery functionality.
