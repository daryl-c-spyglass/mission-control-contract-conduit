Fix description truncation and add flyer preview in Create Flyer dialog.

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## Part 1: Fix Description Truncation

Issue:
- Description is being cut off mid-word (e.g., "...trails, pa")
- Should truncate at a complete word and add "..." 

Fix:
1. Find where description is truncated (likely around 200 characters)
2. Update truncation logic to:
   - Find the last space before the character limit
   - Cut at that space
   - Add "..." at the end
   
Example function:
function truncateDescription(text: string, maxLength: number): string {
  if (text.length <= maxLength) return text;
  
  // Find last space before maxLength
  const truncated = text.substring(0, maxLength);
  const lastSpace = truncated.lastIndexOf(' ');
  
  if (lastSpace > 0) {
    return truncated.substring(0, lastSpace) + '...';
  }
  return truncated + '...';
}

Apply this to the description before rendering on canvas.

## Part 2: Add Flyer Preview

Add a live preview so agents can see the flyer before downloading.

1. Update dialog layout:
   - Left side: Current form (photo selection, fields)
   - Right side: Live preview of flyer
   - Or: Add a "Preview" tab/step before "Generate"

2. Preview component:
   - Show a scaled-down version of the flyer (fit within ~300-400px width)
   - Update in real-time as user:
     - Selects different photos
     - Changes price, status, beds, baths, sqft
     - Edits description
   - Use the same canvas rendering logic but scaled down
   - Add a border/frame around preview

3. Preview should show:
   - Selected main photo (first selected)
   - Status label (Just Listed, etc.)
   - Price
   - Address
   - Beds | Baths | Sq Ft
   - Truncated description (with proper word truncation)
   - Spyglass logo

4. Update button flow:
   - Change "Generate Flyer" button to "Download Flyer"
   - Preview is always visible, so no separate "Preview" button needed
   - When user clicks "Download Flyer", download the full-resolution version

5. Handle loading state:
   - Show loading spinner in preview area while images load
   - Preview updates after images are loaded

6. Responsive behavior:
   - On smaller screens, stack preview below the form
   - On larger screens, show side-by-side

Test by:
1. Open Create Flyer dialog
2. Verify preview appears showing the flyer
3. Change photo selection - preview updates
4. Change price or other fields - preview updates
5. Verify description ends at complete word with "..."
6. Click Download Flyer - full resolution PNG downloads
