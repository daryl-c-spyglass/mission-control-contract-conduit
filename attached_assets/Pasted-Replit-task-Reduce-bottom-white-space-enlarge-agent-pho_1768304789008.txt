Replit task: Reduce bottom white space + enlarge agent photo/logo block + ensure Listing Headline is NOT bold (and keep Preview = Download identical)

Context / current state
- Current downloaded flyer still has too much blank/white space under the bottom content row.
- Agent profile photo (with border) and the Spyglass logo beside it are still too small.
- Listing Headline text (example: “ELEGANCE MEETS COMFORT IN AUSTIN”) is currently appearing bold, but it must NOT be bold.
- Preview must remain pixel-identical to the Downloaded flyer (same render pipeline, same HTML/CSS, same Puppeteer settings). No separate preview template.

Goals (must implement all)
A) Remove extra bottom white space
B) Increase profile photo size + border size, and increase Spyglass logo size in the agent block, without overlapping other sections
C) Listing Headline must be regular weight (not bold)
D) Keep bottom layout aligned and balanced (no overlap, no collision, no clipping)
E) Preview output must match Download output exactly

Implementation details

1) Make bottom row height “content-driven” instead of leaving leftover canvas
- Right now the flyer has unused vertical space at the bottom. Fix by adjusting the layout so the “bottom band” consumes more vertical height and/or is vertically centered within its allocated band.
- Approach:
  - Increase the height of the “bottom band” (the area containing: stats + headline/description + agent info) by shifting the photo grid slightly upward OR reducing the padding/margins between photo grid and bottom band.
  - Then ensure the overall page height stays exactly 11in (or 3300px at 300dpi).
  - Distribute vertical space intentionally:
    - Reduce the gap between the 2nd-row photos and the bottom band by ~24–48px.
    - Increase bottom band padding-top slightly (8–16px) only if needed for balance, but do NOT leave empty space below the band.

2) Expand the photo area slightly (preferred) to eat the blank space
- Increase the height of the large hero photo by ~2–4% and/or increase the height of the secondary 2-photo row by ~2–4%.
- Keep the photo aspect/cropping consistent (object-fit: cover).
- This reduces leftover whitespace while keeping design proportional.

3) Enlarge agent profile + border + Spyglass logo (bottom-right block)
- Increase avatar size:
  - Target: avatar diameter +20% to +35% from current (start with +28%).
  - Border thickness should scale with it (ex: from 3px -> 4px or 5px).
- Increase Spyglass logo size:
  - Target: +20% to +30% (start with +25%).
- Preserve spacing so nothing overlaps:
  - If needed, slightly reduce the agent name font size by 1–2px OR tighten line-height, but keep name readable.
  - Keep the agent block vertically aligned with the stats and description content (same baseline region).

4) Listing Headline font weight must be REGULAR (not bold)
- Ensure CSS for headline explicitly sets:
  - font-weight: 400 (or 500 if the PSD uses medium, but NOT bold).
- Also ensure no inherited bold from parent containers.
- Confirm headline letter-spacing and font-family remain unchanged.

5) Keep “stats column” and “agent column” aligned on X-axis, and remove extra bottom whitespace
- The “stats” (beds/baths/sqft) and the agent phone/name block must share the same vertical baseline region so the layout looks anchored, not floating.
- If enlarging avatar pushes content, adjust the middle column’s padding and line-heights so the bottom row stays compact and balanced.

6) Preview must be identical to Download
- Preview must display the same rendered PNG generated by the same Puppeteer renderFlyer() used for Download.
- No separate CSS, no separate HTML, no “preview mode”.
- Use the same viewport (2550x3300) and same deviceScaleFactor for both.

Checklist / self-test (must run and confirm before shipping)
Visual checks (Download + Preview must both pass):
- [ ] Bottom whitespace reduced significantly (no large empty region under bottom content row).
- [ ] Hero + secondary photos slightly larger OR bottom band repositioned so page feels filled.
- [ ] Avatar is visibly larger; border scales with it; no overlap with agent name/title/phone.
- [ ] Spyglass logo in agent block is larger and still aligned; no overlap.
- [ ] Listing Headline is NOT bold (verify font-weight computed style).
- [ ] No elements clip outside page bounds (top/right/left/bottom).
- [ ] Preview PNG is pixel-identical to Download PNG.

Technical checks:
- [ ] Preview and Download call the same renderFlyer() server function.
- [ ] Same HTML template + same CSS bundle for both.
- [ ] Same Puppeteer viewport and render settings for both.
- [ ] Add/keep a pixel-diff test (pixelmatch) that confirms preview vs download are identical for same inputs.

Deliverables
- Implement the layout changes and commit them.
- Provide:
  1) Files changed
  2) Before/after screenshots (Preview + Download)
  3) Confirmation that checklist passes

Notes
- Do not change divider behavior: we want Y-axis vertical dividers only, aligned to content, no X-axis divider lines.
- Keep all existing typography rules except headline weight (must be non-bold) and any micro-adjustments needed to fit the enlarged avatar/logo.
