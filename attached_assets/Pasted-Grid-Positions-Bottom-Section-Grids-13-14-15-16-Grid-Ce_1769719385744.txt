⚠️ Critical Issue Found
Total width of bottom section elements: 988.72px
Available width: 720px (816 - 48 - 48)

The layout overflows by 268.72px! This explains why your Photo and QR are shifted too far right.

What Grid 15 & 16 Should Look Like
For Photo centered in Grid 15 and QR in Grid 16:

Element	Target X Center	Target Grid
Agent Photo	~510px (Grid 15 center)	Grid 15 (408-612px)
QR Code	~714px (Grid 16 center)	Grid 16 (612-816px)
Photo center in Grid 15: 408 + 102 = 510px
QR center in Grid 16: 612 + 102 = 714px

Root Cause
The column widths don't fit in 720px:

Column	Current Width	Issue
Stats	150.72px	OK
Divider 1 margins + width	46px	OK
Description	432px	Too wide
Divider 2 margins + width	25px	OK
Agent Card	335px	Too wide
Total	988.72px	Exceeds 720px by 268.72px
Summary
Your observation is correct: The current code has the agent card positioned in overflow territory because the Description column (432px) and Agent Card (335px) are too wide for the available space.

To get Photo in Grid 15 and QR in Grid 16, the column widths need to be reduced so the Agent Card container starts around X = 500-520px instead of 701.72px.
