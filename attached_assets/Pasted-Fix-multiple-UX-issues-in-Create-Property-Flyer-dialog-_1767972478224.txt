Fix multiple UX issues in Create Property Flyer dialog.

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## Issue 1: Preview too small - Add clickable enlarge

1. Make the preview section clickable
2. When clicked, open a modal/lightbox showing the full-size preview
3. Add a small "Enlarge" icon or text hint on hover
4. Add X button to close the enlarged preview
5. Apply to both Social Media and Print Flyer formats

## Issue 2: Photo thumbnails too small - Add expand option

1. Add a hover effect on photo thumbnails with an expand/zoom icon
2. When clicked (while holding Alt, or via icon), show larger version in a lightbox
3. OR add an "Expand Photos" toggle that switches to larger thumbnail view
4. Make sure selection still works (click to select, different action to expand)

## Issue 3: "Upload Custom Photos" greyed out when 3/3 selected

Current behavior: Shows "0 slots left" and greyed out when max photos selected
Expected behavior: 
1. Allow users to upload custom photos that REPLACE MLS selections
2. Change text to "Replace with custom photos" when max reached
3. OR allow deselecting MLS photos to free up slots
4. Upload area should always be functional

## Issue 4: Custom photos section has no close button

1. Add a collapse/close button (chevron or X) to the "Upload Custom Photos" section
2. Make it a collapsible accordion that can be toggled open/closed
3. Default state: collapsed
4. Remember: some dialogs scroll, ensure closing doesn't break layout

## Issue 5: Description field hidden when custom photos open

1. Ensure the dialog is scrollable so all fields are accessible
2. OR limit the height of the custom photos section
3. Make sure Description field is always reachable by scrolling
4. Consider making the dialog taller or using a two-column layout

## Issue 6: Description should show FULL text, not truncated

Current: Description is pre-truncated to ~200 chars in the textarea
Expected:
1. Show the FULL description from MLS in the textarea (same as "About This Home")
2. Let users edit it freely
3. Show character count: "246/200" (current chars / limit for format)
4. Truncation happens only at GENERATION time, not in the input field
5. Add helper text: "Description will be truncated to [X] characters on the flyer"

## Issue 7: Character limit should match format

- Social Media format: 200 character limit for description
- Print Flyer format: 115 character limit for description (per Caleb's template)

When user switches format:
1. Update the character counter to show the correct limit
2. Update helper text to reflect the format's limit
3. Keep the full description in textarea (don't auto-truncate)

## Summary of changes needed:

1. Add preview enlarge lightbox (clickable preview → full size modal)
2. Add photo thumbnail expand option (see larger before selecting)
3. Fix custom upload to work even when 3 photos selected (replace mode)
4. Add collapse button to custom photos section
5. Ensure dialog scrolls properly to show all fields
6. Load FULL description in textarea, truncate only at generation
7. Dynamic character limit based on format (200 vs 115)

Test by:
1. Open Create Flyer dialog
2. Click preview - should open enlarged view
3. Try to expand a photo thumbnail to see it larger
4. Select 3 photos, then try to upload custom - should work
5. Open custom photos section, verify it can be closed
6. Scroll dialog to verify Description field is visible
7. Check Description shows full MLS text
8. Switch between formats, verify character limit updates
