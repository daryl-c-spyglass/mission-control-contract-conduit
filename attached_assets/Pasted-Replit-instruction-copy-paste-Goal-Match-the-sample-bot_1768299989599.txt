Replit instruction (copy/paste)

Goal: Match the sample bottom section layout exactly (see /mnt/data/6a989cd8-6e68-49e1-8a65-ce7f860753c0.png). Update ONLY the bottom info band; do not change header/photos logic. Preview and Download must always use the exact same render pipeline and CSS.

A) Bottom band layout (3 columns)

Implement a 3-column grid for the bottom band:

Left column: stats (bed/bath/sqft) with icons

Middle column: headline + description (description left-aligned)

Right column: agent block (large photo + logo to the right of photo + stacked text)

Use a shared parent container for the bottom band so divider heights are derived from actual content height.

B) Enlarge agent photo + right column structure

Increase agent profile photo size to match sample prominence:

Make photo circle ~86–96px diameter (target 90px)

Keep a thin stroke ring if needed (light warm gray)

Agent block text stack must be exactly:

Line 1: Agent Name (bold)

Line 2: Agent Title (small caps / lighter weight)

Line 3: Phone (regular weight)

Spyglass logo placement:

Place a small square logo tile to the right of the photo, vertically centered with the photo (like sample).

Maintain consistent padding between photo and logo tile.

C) Stats alignment rule (critical)

We need the sq ft row baseline to align with the last line of the description block (like the sample).

Implement this as a deterministic CSS layout rule:

Make the bottom band a grid with align-items: stretch

Inside the left stats column, make it a flex column with justify-content: flex-end

Ensure the last stat row (sqft) sits at the bottom of the bottom band content area

Inside the middle column, description should naturally define the bottom edge; keep it left aligned.

The result must be: sq ft row baseline ≈ description last line baseline (within ~2–4px)

Do NOT use absolute positioning that breaks in Preview vs Download.

D) Dividers (Y-axis only) and height

Only vertical dividers are allowed.

Divider height must equal the computed height of the bottom band content, not the full page.

Dividers must NOT extend into white space below the bottom band.

Dividers must NOT overlap text.

Implementation detail:

Make dividers height: 100% of the bottom-band container, not page height.

Bottom band container height should be driven by content; no fixed huge min-height.

E) Preview must always match Download (non-negotiable)

Currently preview and download can drift when they use different viewport scaling / CSS / render code.

Enforce one pipeline:

Both Preview and Download must call the same renderFlyer(format: 'print') function

Both must load the same HTML template and CSS bundle

Both must use the same Puppeteer settings:

deviceScaleFactor consistent

same viewport size

same page margins

same printBackground: true

If preview uses a screenshot and download uses PDF or different viewport, unify them:

Render a single “print master” image buffer (PNG) from Puppeteer

Preview displays that PNG

Download uses that same PNG and/or PDF generated from the same DOM + CSS (no branching CSS)

F) Acceptance tests checklist (Replit must verify each)

Agent photo is visibly larger (≈90px) and dominates right column like sample.

Agent text is stacked: Name (bold) / Title (lighter) / Phone (regular).

Description is left-aligned (not centered).

Sq ft row baseline aligns with description last line baseline (±4px).

Vertical dividers height matches bottom band content height only.

No horizontal dividers appear in bottom band.

Preview output is pixel-identical to Download output (same render pipeline).
