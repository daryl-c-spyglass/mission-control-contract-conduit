Fix AI Description Summary to generate complete sentences, not truncated text.

Files to modify:
- server/routes.ts (the /api/summarize-description endpoint)

## Issue

The AI summary is generating text that gets cut off with "..." at the character limit.
Examples:
- "...like a Jr Olympic pool and tennis courts. Move-in..." (cut off)
- "...with easy access..." (cut off)

The description should END as a complete sentence, not mid-thought.

## Fix the AI Prompt

Update the prompt for /api/summarize-description:
You are a real estate copywriter. Write a compelling property description summary.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Maximum {maxLength} characters (strict limit - count carefully!)
Must be a COMPLETE thought - end with a full sentence
Do NOT end mid-sentence or with "..."
Do NOT write more than the limit and truncate
The summary should feel finished and polished

STYLE:

Engaging and professional
Highlight key selling points
Focus on: location, features, lifestyle benefits
Do not repeat beds/baths/sqft (shown separately)

Property: {address}
Original description:
{description}
Write a summary that is UNDER {maxLength} characters and ends with a complete sentence.
Count your characters carefully before responding.
Return only the summary text, nothing else.

## Additional Server-Side Validation

After receiving AI response:

1. Check if response ends with "..." - if so, remove trailing "..." and find last complete sentence
2. Check if response ends mid-word - truncate to last complete word
3. Ensure response ends with proper punctuation (. ! or similar)
```javascript
function cleanupSummary(text: string, maxLength: number): string {
  let cleaned = text.trim();
  
  // Remove trailing "..." if present
  if (cleaned.endsWith('...')) {
    cleaned = cleaned.slice(0, -3).trim();
  }
  
  // If still over limit, truncate at last sentence
  if (cleaned.length > maxLength) {
    // Find last sentence-ending punctuation within limit
    const truncated = cleaned.substring(0, maxLength);
    const lastPeriod = truncated.lastIndexOf('.');
    const lastExclaim = truncated.lastIndexOf('!');
    const lastSentenceEnd = Math.max(lastPeriod, lastExclaim);
    
    if (lastSentenceEnd > maxLength * 0.5) {
      // Use last complete sentence if it's not too short
      cleaned = truncated.substring(0, lastSentenceEnd + 1);
    } else {
      // Otherwise truncate at last space and add period
      const lastSpace = truncated.lastIndexOf(' ');
      cleaned = truncated.substring(0, lastSpace) + '.';
    }
  }
  
  // Ensure ends with punctuation
  if (!/[.!?]$/.test(cleaned)) {
    cleaned += '.';
  }
  
  return cleaned;
}
```

## Update Character Display

In the UI, also update the helper text:

Current: "Click AI Summarize again for a different variation"
Add: Show green checkmark when description is complete (ends with punctuation, under limit)
Show warning if description appears truncated

Test by:
1. Click AI Summarize multiple times
2. Verify each summary ends with a complete sentence
3. Verify no "..." at the end
4. Verify summaries feel complete and polished
5. Check both Social Media (200 char) and Print Flyer (115 char) limits
