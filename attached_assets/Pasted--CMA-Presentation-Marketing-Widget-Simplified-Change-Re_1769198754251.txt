## 🔧 Updated Component

```tsx
// components/cma-presentation/widgets/MarketingWidget.tsx

export function MarketingWidget() {
  return (
    <div className="h-full overflow-auto bg-white">
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6 md:p-10">
        
        {/* Intro Section */}
        <div className="text-center mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
            Where are homebuyers looking for information?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            One of our top priorities is making sure we market your property in the places 
            your future buyer is looking. We take a look at marketing- and buyer-behavior 
            trends to determine where to invest our resources. The latest data indicates 
            we need to invest in our website, our signage and marketing materials, and 
            our continued professional development.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Infographic Image */}
        <div>
          <img
            src="/cma-widgets/marketing-infographic.png"
            alt="How We Drive Interest To Your Property - Private Facebook Groups and Google SEO"
            className="w-full h-auto"
          />
        </div>

        {/* NO STATISTICS CARDS - REMOVED */}
        
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 📋 Copy/Paste for Replit

```
Update the Marketing widget (Widget 4) - REMOVE statistics cards, show only intro text + infographic image.

## REMOVE:
- All statistics cards (96%, 52%, 28%, 8%)
- "HOW WE DRIVE INTEREST TO YOUR PROPERTY" heading above cards
- The entire StatCard component and grid

## KEEP/ADD:
1. Heading: "Where are homebuyers looking for information?"
   - className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 text-center"

2. Paragraph (centered):
   "One of our top priorities is making sure we market your property in the places your future buyer is looking. We take a look at marketing- and buyer-behavior trends to determine where to invest our resources. The latest data indicates we need to invest in our website, our signage and marketing materials, and our continued professional development."
   - className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-center"

3. Infographic image (I've attached it):
   - Save to: public/cma-widgets/marketing-infographic.png
   - Display: <img src="/cma-widgets/marketing-infographic.png" className="w-full h-auto" />
   - No rounded corners or shadow needed - let the image display as-is

## FINAL STRUCTURE:
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6 md:p-10">
  <div className="text-center mb-8">
    <h2>Where are homebuyers looking for information?</h2>
    <p>One of our top priorities...</p>
  </div>
  <img src="/cma-widgets/marketing-infographic.png" className="w-full h-auto" />
</div>

That's it - simple and clean like CloudCMA.
```

## ✅ Expected Result

Just two elements:
1. **Intro text** (heading + paragraph, centered)
2. **Infographic image** (full width below text)

No statistics cards, no extra sections.
