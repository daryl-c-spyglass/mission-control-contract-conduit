Here is a data from THE FLYER MAKER project a separate project , lets use this to fix the grid lins and make sure the photo are on the exact coordinates.

Now I'll implement the read-only instrumentation. I'll add:

data-layout-id attributes to all layout blocks
A measurement function that captures coordinates
Console logging of the layout map
A dev-only export button
The instrumentation is working. The console logs show FLYER_LAYOUT_COORDINATES_READ_ONLY being logged with all the layout blocks. Let me run a quick e2e test to verify the application still works correctly and the export button functions properly.

The instrumentation is complete and verified. Let me have the architect review these changes.

Good catch by the review. I need to fix two issues:

Measurements are at 0.65 scale - need to normalize to 1.0
Layout logging should happen before PNG/CMYK export
The scale normalization is now working correctly. The console logs show:

Canvas: 816 x 1056 px (correct 1.0 scale)
All coordinates are now normalized to true flyer dimensions
✅ Layout Instrumentation Complete
What Was Added (Read-Only)
1. Data Attributes on Layout Blocks:

flyer-canvas - Main canvas container
header-section - Header area
accent-bar - Gold vertical bar
logo-primary - Main company logo
logo-secondary - Secondary logo
price-box - Price badge
address - Property address
main-photo - Hero property image
secondary-photos-row - Container for smaller photos
photo-2 - Kitchen image
photo-3 - Room image
bottom-section - Bottom 3-column area
stats - Beds/baths/sqft stats
description-column - Description area
headline - Intro heading
description - Intro text
agent-card - Agent info section
agent-photo - Agent headshot
qr-code - QR code block
2. Console Logging:

FLYER_LAYOUT_COORDINATES_READ_ONLY logged on initial render
Also logged before PNG/CMYK export
3. Export Layout JSON Button:

Ghost icon button (FileJson icon) in header
Downloads flyer-layout.json with all coordinates
Shows toast notification on success
4. Scale Normalization:

Coordinates are normalized to 1.0 scale (816x1056)
Regardless of preview scale (0.65)
Sample Output
{
  "canvas": { "width": 816, "height": 1056 },
  "blocks": [
    { "id": "main-photo", "x": 48, "y": 156, "width": 720, "height": 360, "zIndex": 0 },
    { "id": "photo-2", "x": 48, "y": 530, "width": 355, "height": 230, "zIndex": 0 },
    ...
  ],
  "timestamp": "2026-01-29T..."
}
Unchanged
All flyer visuals remain pixel-identical
No layout, styling, or behavioral changes
Export PNG/CMYK functionality unchanged
