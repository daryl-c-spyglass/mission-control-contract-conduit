Final refinements for Print Flyer to match template exactly.

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## FIX 1: Decorative Squares Position

Current: Squares are overlapping the agent photo circle awkwardly
Template: Squares are in the CORNER, separate from the photo

Move the decorative squares to the TOP-RIGHT corner of the agent section, NOT overlapping the photo:
```javascript
// Position squares in corner, above and to the right of agent photo
const squaresX = agentSectionX + agentSectionWidth - (squareSize * 3) - 10;
const squaresY = agentSectionY + 10; // Top of agent section

// Draw small grid (3x3 or 2x3)
for (let row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
  for (let col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
    ctx.fillStyle = (row + col) % 2 === 0 ? '#000000' : '#FFFFFF';
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#000000';
    ctx.lineWidth = 1;
    ctx.fillRect(squaresX + col * squareSize, squaresY + row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);
    ctx.strokeRect(squaresX + col * squareSize, squaresY + row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);
  }
}
```

The squares should be a decorative element in the corner, not covering the agent photo.

## FIX 2: Reduce Bottom White Space

Still too much empty space at bottom. Options:

1. **Increase vertical spacing** between elements in bottom section
2. **Make fonts larger:**
   - Property stats: 52px
   - Headline: 40px
   - Description: 32px
   - Agent name: 46px

3. **Add more padding/margins** between the three columns

4. **Move entire bottom section down** slightly so content extends closer to page edge

## FIX 3: Make Spyglass Logos Larger

**Header logo (top left):**
- Current: Small and unclear
- Fix: Increase to ~250px wide, ensure it's crisp and readable

**Agent section logo (bottom right):**
- Current: Tiny and unclear  
- Fix: Increase to ~120px wide

Load the high-resolution logo files and scale appropriately.

## FIX 4: Icons (Lower Priority for MVP)

The icons are functional but not matching the template's specific designs.

For MVP: Current icons are acceptable
Future: Replace with exact template icons (bed with posts, bathtub with faucet/legs, sqft with diagonal arrow)

## TESTING

Generate flyer and verify:
- [ ] Decorative squares in corner, not overlapping photo
- [ ] Less white space at bottom
- [ ] Logos are clear and readable
- [ ] Overall appearance is professional and balanced
