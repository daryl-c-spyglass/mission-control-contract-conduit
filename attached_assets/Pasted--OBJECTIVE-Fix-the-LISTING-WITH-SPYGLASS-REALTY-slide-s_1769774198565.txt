## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Fix the "LISTING WITH SPYGLASS REALTY" slide so the PDF output matches the Preview. Currently the logo displays differently between Preview and PDF export.

## 🐛 ISSUE
| View | Logo Display |
|------|--------------|
| Preview (Slide 3) | ✅ Correct - Shows full logo image (Spyglass + Leading Real Estate Companies of the World) |
| PDF Export (Slide 2) | ❌ Wrong - Shows only "SPYGLASS REALTY" text, missing the full logo |

## 📎 CORRECT LOGO
The attached logo file `LRE_SGR_Black.png` should be used for BOTH Preview and PDF export.

This logo contains:
- Spyglass Realty logo on the left
- Divider line
- "Leading Real Estate Companies of the World" on the right
- Black background

## 🔍 DIAGNOSTIC
1. Find the CMA Presentation slide component that renders "LISTING WITH SPYGLASS REALTY"
2. Check how the logo is rendered in Preview vs PDF generation
3. Identify why PDF uses text fallback instead of the image

Search for:
```bash
grep -r "LISTING WITH SPYGLASS" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "LRE_SGR" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "Leading Real Estate" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
```

## ✅ FIX REQUIRED
Ensure the PDF generation uses the same logo image as the Preview:

1. The logo image path should be consistent between Preview and PDF
2. If PDF generation can't access the image URL, embed the image as base64
3. Both should display the full `LRE_SGR_Black.png` logo

## 📁 LOGO FILE LOCATION
Upload the attached `LRE_SGR_Black.png` to the appropriate assets folder if not already present:
- `public/logos/LRE_SGR_Black.png` or
- `client/src/assets/LRE_SGR_Black.png`

## ✅ VERIFICATION
After fix:
- [ ] Preview Slide 3 shows full logo image
- [ ] PDF export Slide 2/3 shows SAME full logo image
- [ ] Logo displays correctly on black background
- [ ] Both views are visually identical

## 📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
Ensure logo scales properly on:
- Desktop PDF view
- Mobile PDF view
- Preview on tablet/mobile
