Sync the OpenStreetMap on MLS Data tab with the app's light/dark mode setting.

Files to modify:
- client/src/components/transaction-details.tsx (map component)
- Check where theme state is managed (likely a context or hook)

## Issue

The map at the bottom of the MLS Data tab is always dark. It should sync with the user's light/dark mode selection from the toggle in the upper right corner.

## Requirements

1. Detect current theme mode:
   - Find where the theme toggle state is stored (likely React context, localStorage, or a theme provider)
   - Subscribe to theme changes

2. Update map tiles based on theme:

   **Light Mode:**
   - Use standard OpenStreetMap tiles: 
     `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
   - OR use CartoDB Positron (light): 
     `https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png`

   **Dark Mode:**
   - Use CartoDB Dark Matter: 
     `https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png`

3. Ensure street names are readable in dark mode:
   - CartoDB Dark Matter has readable labels built-in
   - If using a different dark tile set, verify text contrast
   - Test that street names, city names, and landmarks are visible

4. Update attribution based on tile provider:
   - Light: "© OpenStreetMap contributors" (or add "© CARTO" if using CartoDB)
   - Dark: "© OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO"

5. Handle theme changes dynamically:
   - When user toggles theme, map should update immediately
   - No page refresh required

## Implementation
```javascript
// Example implementation
const { theme } = useTheme(); // or however theme is accessed

const tileUrl = theme === 'dark' 
  ? 'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'
  : 'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png';

const attribution = '© <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors © <a href="https://carto.com/attributions">CARTO</a>';
```

6. Marker visibility:
   - Ensure the property marker pin is visible on both light and dark maps
   - May need to adjust marker color if it blends in

Test by:
1. Set app to Light mode - verify map shows light tiles with readable streets
2. Set app to Dark mode - verify map shows dark tiles with readable streets
3. Toggle between modes - verify map updates without page refresh
4. Check street names are clearly readable in both modes
5. Verify marker pin is visible in both modes
