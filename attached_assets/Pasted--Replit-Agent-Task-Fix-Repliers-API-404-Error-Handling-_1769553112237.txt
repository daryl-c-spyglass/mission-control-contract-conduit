# Replit Agent Task: Fix Repliers API 404 Error Handling

## Problem
The application is logging excessive errors when the Repliers API returns a 404 for listings that don't have comparable properties. This is flooding the logs and treating expected "no data" responses as errors.

## Current Behavior
When fetching similar listings, a 404 response throws an error:
```
Error fetching similar listings: Error: Repliers API error: 404 Not Found -
```

This happens repeatedly (8+ times in 2 minutes during testing) and clutters the logs.

## Desired Behavior
1. A 404 response should be handled gracefully as "no comparables found" - not an error
2. Log it as a WARNING (not error) with the specific MLS number for debugging
3. Return an empty array instead of throwing
4. Other HTTP errors (500, 401, etc.) should still throw as errors

## Task
1. Find the file that contains the Repliers API integration (search for "Error fetching similar listings" or "Repliers API error")

2. Update the error handling to treat 404 as a valid "no data" response:

```typescript
// Handle 404 as "no comparables found" - not an error
if (!response.ok) {
  if (response.status === 404) {
    console.warn(`[Repliers] No comparables found for MLS# ${mlsNumber}`);
    return { photos: [], comparables: [] }; // or appropriate empty structure
  }
  // Only throw for actual errors (500, 401, etc.)
  throw new Error(`Repliers API error: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
}
```

3. Make sure the MLS number being queried is included in the warning message so we can track which properties have no comparables

4. Test by running the app and triggering a CMA request - verify:
   - 404s now show as warnings, not errors
   - The MLS number appears in the log
   - The app continues working (returns 0 comparables instead of failing)

## Additional Context
- This affects both Replit dev environment and Render production
- The specific MLS# that consistently returns 404 is: `8932820` (323 Blackbear Dr, Hutto, TX)
- Other MLS numbers with ACT prefix (like `ACT9921752`) work fine
- The fix should be backwards compatible - don't change the successful response handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 404 responses logged as warnings, not errors
- [ ] MLS number included in warning message
- [ ] Empty comparables returned (not thrown error)
- [ ] Other HTTP errors still throw properly
- [ ] App continues to function normally
