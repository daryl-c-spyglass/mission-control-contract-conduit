Here’s a clear overview of **how CloudCMA calculates its *Price per Acre* and related scatter chart data**, what it means, and where you can find more information and supporting resources.

## 🧠 What CloudCMA Does (General CMA Context)

**CloudCMA** is a real estate CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) software that helps agents create CMA reports using live MLS data pulled from your MLS provider. It’s designed to help you analyze *comparable properties (comps)* to estimate *fair market value* for a subject property. ([Lwolf Community][1])

* CMA = *Comparative Market Analysis*: an estimate of market value based on recent sales and active listings of similar properties. ([Real Estate Witch][2])
* CloudCMA pulls accessible MLS data (sale prices, list prices, property metrics) and uses that as the foundation for all analytics in its reports. ([Lwolf Community][1])

## 📊 How *Price/Acre* Is Calculated in CMA Reports

CloudCMA doesn’t publish public technical documentation on *exact internal formulas* for charts (e.g., Price/Acre scatter plots). However, based on what *CMA data outputs represent* and how CMAs are built, here’s how this metric is generally derived:

### 💡 Components Used

1. **Raw MLS data**

   * Sale price and list price from recent comparable properties.
   * Property attribute data including *lot size (in acres)*.
     CloudCMA includes fields like *Average Price per Acre* in its CMA data pages. ([Cloud CMA][3])

2. **Base calculation principle**
   Price per Acre for each comparable property =
   **Sale Price ÷ Lot Size (in acres)**
   (Lot size is typically reported by the MLS.)
   This formula is a common standard in land pricing and real estate analytics. ([omnicalculator.com][4])
   — *Example:* If a property sold for $500,000 and has 2.5 acres, then Price/Acre = $200,000/acre.

3. **Aggregation for charts**

   * When CloudCMA plots a scatter chart (e.g., price/acre vs year or lot size), each point likely represents a *comparable sale’s Price/Acre* computed as above.
   * Tools like CloudCMA allow formatting charts under “Average Price per Acre” or “Average pricing” pages. ([Cloud CMA][3])

### 📈 Scatter Chart Purpose

A typical *Price per Acre plot* in a CMA helps visualize:

* How land value (price per acre) varies across recent sales.
* Whether the subject property’s pricing is in line with local market trends.
* Outliers or trends based on parcel size.

Agents use it to justify pricing decisions when presenting to sellers or buyers.

## 📌 How It Fits Into a CMA Workflow

CloudCMA’s process roughly follows these steps:

1. **Select subject property & comps** – choose recently sold properties similar in location, lot size, and features. ([Support Hub][5])
2. **Fetch MLS data** – automatically pulls in price, acreage, sale date, etc. ([Lwolf Community][1])
3. **Compute price metrics** – standard fields like Price/SqFt or Price/Acre will be derived from MLS values.
4. **Display as charts/tables** – reports include summary stats and visual analytics. ([Cloud CMA][3])

> *Note:* CloudCMA itself doesn’t replace an appraisal — it is a comparative tool based on *comps selected and MLS data*, with agent judgment layered in. ([Real Estate Witch][2])
