✅ REPLIT MASTER PROMPT — SPYGLASS PRINT FLYER (FINAL ALIGNMENT PASS)
Objective

Fix the remaining layout, alignment, sizing, and preview-sync issues in the Spyglass 8.5×11 Print Flyer so that:

The Preview output is pixel-identical to the Downloaded PNG/PDF

All dividers, icons, text, and photos match the provided Spyglass PSD reference

No divider overlaps any text or images

Bottom section matches the reference sample exactly in alignment and visual weight

This is a layout-only change. Do not change endpoints, data mapping, or rendering pipeline.

1️⃣ CRITICAL RULE — PREVIEW MUST MATCH DOWNLOAD

Hard requirement:

The Preview image must be rendered using the exact same HTML + CSS + Puppeteer render path as the Download Flyer.

No alternate CSS, scaling, containers, or responsive rules for preview.

Preview = scaled-down screenshot of the final rendered print canvas (2550×3300), nothing else.

If Preview and Download differ in spacing, divider length, font size, or alignment, that is a failure.

2️⃣ CANVAS & GRID (DO NOT CHANGE SIZE)

Canvas: 2550 × 3300 px (8.5×11 @ 300 DPI)

Use fixed layout, no responsive behavior

Use CSS Grid for the bottom section

No vh, %, or auto-growing dividers

3️⃣ HEADER FIXES (TOP SECTION)
Vertical divider (left of logo & address)

Vertical (Y-axis only) — NO horizontal component

Color: same neutral gray as PSD

Thickness: 3–4px

Position:

Offset slightly away from logo and address

Must NOT touch logo text or address text

Must NOT overlap the hero photo

Height:

Only spans the height of the logo + address block

DO NOT extend into the hero image

Address text

Regular weight (NOT bold)

Left-aligned

Vertically centered relative to logo

Price badge (upper right)

Shape: angled tag (not a rectangle)

Text color: black

Font weight: regular (not bold)

No overlap with hero image

Divider color matches PSD gray

4️⃣ PHOTO SECTION

Hero photo spans full width under header

Bottom photo row contains 3 images

Increase bottom photo row height slightly to reduce excess white space below

Maintain consistent gutters between photos

No dividers overlapping images

5️⃣ BOTTOM SECTION — MOST IMPORTANT FIXES
Layout columns (LEFT → CENTER → RIGHT)
| Stats (icons) | Headline + Description | Agent |


Use CSS Grid with fixed column widths.

LEFT COLUMN — Stats (Bedrooms / Bathrooms / Sq Ft)

Use the provided icons:

Bedroom icon

Bathroom icon

Sq ft icon

Each stat is ONE LINE:

[icon] 4 bedrooms
[icon] 2 bathrooms
[icon] 1,850 sq. ft


Vertically align this entire block so that:

Sq ft baseline aligns horizontally (X-axis) with the Agent phone number

Bedrooms & bathrooms sit slightly above, as in the PSD

This block may be nudged downward slightly to achieve alignment

Text is regular weight, not bold

CENTER COLUMN — Listing Headline & Description
Listing Headline

All caps

Regular font weight (NOT bold)

Centered horizontally

Appears above the description

Must NOT drift downward when description length changes

Dividers around headline & description

Vertical dividers only (Y-axis)

No horizontal dividers in this section

Divider height:

Starts at top of headline

Ends at bottom of description text

Exactly matches text height

Divider thickness: 3–4px

Color: PSD gray

Dividers must NEVER overlap text

Description

Left-aligned text

Target length: 115–150 characters

Allow AI Summarize to generate up to 150 chars (do not cap at 115)

Description bottom aligns visually with:

Sq ft text (left)

Agent phone number (right)

RIGHT COLUMN — Agent Info

Increase profile photo size to match PSD reference

Circular crop

Agent name:

Single line only (no wrapping or truncation)

Larger than title

Agent title:

Smaller, lighter weight

Phone number:

Regular weight (NOT bold)

Horizontally aligned with Sq ft on the left column

Spyglass logo:

Larger than current

Positioned to the right of the profile photo

Vertically centered with photo

6️⃣ DIVIDER RULES (GLOBAL)

Use ONLY vertical (Y-axis) dividers

NO horizontal lines anywhere in the bottom section

Divider height must always be content-bound, never full-height

Divider must never:

Overlap text

Touch icons

Extend into white space below content

7️⃣ ALIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Bedrooms / Bathrooms / Sq ft block

Description text

Agent phone number

👉 All three must align on the same X-axis baseline

8️⃣ ASCII DIAGRAM (REFERENCE)
TOP HEADER
|  | LOGO + ADDRESS          PRICE TAG |
|  |-----------------------------------|

HERO IMAGE (full width)

PHOTO ROW (3 images)

BOTTOM SECTION (Grid)
-----------------------------------------------------
| [icon] beds     | HEADLINE (regular weight) | O |
| [icon] baths    | Description (left-aligned)| O |

|                 |                            | O |
-----------------------------------------------------

Legend:
| = vertical divider (Y-axis only)
O = agent photo + logo
