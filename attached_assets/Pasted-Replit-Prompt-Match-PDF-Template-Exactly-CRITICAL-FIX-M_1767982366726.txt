Replit Prompt: Match PDF Template Exactly
CRITICAL FIX: Match the Print Flyer exactly to the PDF template.

Reference the uploaded screenshots showing the exact PDF layout:
- Screenshot 1: Header with Spyglass logo + price badge (NO "Leading" logo!)
- Screenshot 2: Photo layout (main + 2 secondary)
- Screenshot 3: Bottom section with icons, description, agent info, QR code

File: client/src/components/create-flyer-dialog.tsx

## MAJOR CORRECTIONS NEEDED

### Fix 1: Remove "Leading Real Estate Companies" from Header

Current: Shows "Leading" script text in header
Template: Does NOT have this - only Spyglass logo on left, price badge on right

Update header to:
- LEFT: Spyglass logo on black background rectangle
- CENTER: Empty (no Leading logo)
- RIGHT: Price badge (pentagon/arrow shape pointing left)

### Fix 2: Price Badge Shape

Current: Rectangle
Template: Pentagon/arrow shape pointing LEFT (like a ribbon or tag)

Draw the price badge as a polygon:
```javascript
// Pentagon shape pointing left
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(x, y + height/2);           // Left point (arrow tip)
ctx.lineTo(x + 40, y);                  // Top left
ctx.lineTo(x + width, y);               // Top right
ctx.lineTo(x + width, y + height);      // Bottom right
ctx.lineTo(x + 40, y + height);         // Bottom left
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fillStyle = '#8b7355'; // Tan/brown color from template
ctx.fill();
```

### Fix 3: Icon Style - MUST Match Template Exactly

Look at Screenshot 3 - the icons are specific line drawings:

**Bed Icon:**
- Horizontal frame with vertical headboard on left
- Simple lines, NOT filled shapes
- Has small "posts" or legs

**Bath Icon:**
- Bathtub shape with curved body
- Has faucet extending up on left side
- Has two small legs/feet at bottom
- Line drawing style

**Sqft Icon:**
- Rectangle outline
- Diagonal line from corner to corner
- Small arrow head at one end
- Represents "area/square footage"

Draw these as canvas paths with stroke (not fill):
```javascript
ctx.strokeStyle = '#333333';
ctx.lineWidth = 3;
// Draw each icon as line paths...
```

### Fix 4: Bottom Section Must Fill More Space

Current: Bottom section is compressed, too much white space below
Template: Bottom section fills ~40% of the page

Increase the bottom section:
- Property stats: Larger font (48px for numbers, 36px for labels)
- More vertical spacing between items (100px between each stat)
- Description: Larger font (32px), more line height
- Agent section: Larger photo (200px diameter)

### Fix 5: Add Black/White Decorative Squares

In Screenshot 3, notice the geometric pattern around the agent photo area:
- Small alternating black and white squares
- Creates a decorative border/frame effect
- Position: Around/behind the agent photo area
```javascript
// Draw decorative squares pattern
const squareSize = 30;
for (let row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
  for (let col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
    const isBlack = (row + col) % 2 === 0;
    ctx.fillStyle = isBlack ? '#000' : '#fff';
    ctx.fillRect(
      agentX + col * squareSize,
      agentY + row * squareSize,
      squareSize,
      squareSize
    );
  }
}
```

### Fix 6: Add QR Code Placeholder

Template has QR code below agent info.

For now, draw a placeholder:
```javascript
// QR code placeholder
ctx.strokeStyle = '#333';
ctx.lineWidth = 2;
ctx.strokeRect(qrX, qrY, 100, 100);
// Draw simple QR-like pattern inside
// Or use a QR code library to generate actual QR
```

Future enhancement: Generate real QR code linking to listing.

### Fix 7: Address Format with Full Location

Template shows: "142 N STEEL CREEK CREST HIGHWAY CENTER POINT, TX 78010"

Include full address with:
- Street address
- City
- State abbreviation
- Zip code
- Apply letter spacing to entire address

### Fix 8: Remove Gold Footer Bar

Looking at the template, there is NO gold footer bar at the bottom.
The content just ends with the bottom info section.
Remove the footer bar if present.

## EXACT LAYOUT (Top to Bottom)

1. **Header Bar** (height: ~80px)
   - Black background
   - Spyglass logo left
   - Price badge right (pentagon shape)

2. **Address Bar** (height: ~60px)
   - Full address with letter spacing
   - Centered

3. **Main Photo** (height: ~45% of page)
   - Full width

4. **Secondary Photos** (height: ~25% of page)
   - Two photos side by side
   - Small gap between them

5. **Bottom Info Section** (height: ~25% of page)
   - Three columns
   - LEFT: Property stats with proper icons
   - CENTER: Headline + description
   - RIGHT: Agent photo + decorative squares + name/title/phone + QR code

## VERIFICATION

After changes, the flyer should look nearly identical to the PDF:
- [ ] Header: Only Spyglass logo + price badge (NO Leading logo)
- [ ] Price badge: Pentagon/arrow shape
- [ ] Icons: Line drawings matching template style
- [ ] Bottom section: Fills space, minimal white space
- [ ] Decorative squares: Present around agent area
- [ ] QR code placeholder: Present
- [ ] Full address: Street, city, state, zip
