# Replit Agent Task: DIAGNOSTIC - Identify Time to Sell Modal Components

## Problem
The property detail modal inside the **Time to Sell slide** is not being updated. We need to identify the exact file and component structure before making changes.

## What I Need You To Do

### Step 1: Search for Time to Sell Related Files

Run these searches and report the results:

```bash
# Find all files related to Time to Sell
find . -type f -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l -i "time.*to.*sell\|timetosell" 2>/dev/null

# Find all modal components
find . -type f -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l -i "modal" 2>/dev/null

# Find property detail related files
find . -type f -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l -i "PropertyDetail\|property.*detail" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Identify the Component Hierarchy

For the Time to Sell slide, tell me:

1. **Main Time to Sell slide component** - What file is it in?
2. **Property sidebar/list component** - What renders the list of properties on the left?
3. **Property card panel** - What appears when you click a property in the sidebar?
4. **Property detail modal** - What opens when you click "View" or the full card?

### Step 3: Report the File Structure

Please provide a tree view of the relevant files:

```
client/src/
├── components/
│   ├── cma/
│   │   ├── slides/
│   │   │   └── TimeToSellSlide.tsx  (or similar)
│   │   └── ...
│   └── modals/
│       └── PropertyDetailModal.tsx  (or similar)
└── ...
```

### Step 4: Show Me the Import Chain

For the Time to Sell slide, show me:

1. What modal component does it import?
2. What is the exact import path?

Example:
```tsx
// In TimeToSellSlide.tsx
import { PropertyDetailModal } from '../modals/PropertyDetailModal';
// or
import { PropertyCardPanel } from './PropertyCardPanel';
```

### Step 5: Identify Modal Trigger

Show me the code where the modal is triggered when clicking a property. Look for:
- `onClick` handlers
- State like `selectedProperty`, `showModal`, `isOpen`
- Conditional rendering of modal components

## DO NOT Make Any Changes Yet

This is a **diagnostic task only**. Do not modify any files. Just report the findings so we can identify the correct component to update.

## After You Report

Once you've identified the correct files, I will provide the updated implementation for the specific modal component used in the Time to Sell slide.
