# Replit Agent Task: REVERT COMPS Slide Modal to Previous Version

## Problem
The recent changes accidentally updated the **COMPS slide modal** instead of the Time to Sell slide modal. The COMPS slide was working correctly before and now needs to be reverted.

## URGENT: Revert Changes

### Step 1: Identify Changed Files

Check git history for recently modified files related to the COMPS slide or PropertyDetailModal:

```bash
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Revert the COMPS Modal

Revert the PropertyDetailModal (or whichever component renders the COMPS slide modal) to its previous working state:

```bash
# Option 1: Revert specific file
git checkout HEAD~1 -- [path/to/PropertyDetailModal.tsx]

# Option 2: If multiple files changed
git checkout HEAD~1 -- client/src/components/cma/
```

### Step 3: Verify the Revert

After reverting, confirm:
1. The COMPS slide modal looks like it did before (3-column layout with map, photo, details)
2. Google Maps embed is back (this was the original working version)
3. All functionality works as before

## What the COMPS Slide Modal Should Look Like (Previous Working Version)

The COMPS slide modal should have:

**Header:**
- X close button
- Address + State

**Layout (3-column or original layout):**
- Map section (Google Maps embed was working fine)
- Photo gallery with navigation
- Property stats grid
- Price details on the right side

**DO NOT** apply the 2-column Mapbox layout to the COMPS slide - that was intended for the Time to Sell slide only.

---

## After Reverting

Once the COMPS slide is back to its working state, please confirm:

1. "COMPS slide modal has been reverted to previous version"
2. Show me the file path that was reverted
3. Confirm the layout is back to the original 3-column (or whatever it was before)

## IMPORTANT

- **DO NOT** make any changes to the Time to Sell slide yet
- **ONLY** revert the COMPS slide modal
- Keep the COMPS slide exactly as it was before today's changes
