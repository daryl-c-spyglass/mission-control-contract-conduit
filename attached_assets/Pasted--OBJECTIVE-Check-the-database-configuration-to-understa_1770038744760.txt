## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Check the database configuration to understand what needs to be migrated for Ryan's request to move Contract Conduit to Render without disturbing Randi's workflow.

## 📋 QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### 1. How Many Databases Exist?
In Replit, I see "Development Database" and "Production Database" tabs.
- Are these TWO separate databases with different data?
- Or is this the same database with different connection methods?

### 2. Check DATABASE_URL Configuration
Show me:
- What is the current DATABASE_URL in Replit Secrets?
- Is there a separate DEV_DATABASE_URL or PROD_DATABASE_URL?
- Which database is the app actually connecting to?

### 3. Compare Transaction Counts
Run on BOTH databases (if separate):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM transactions;
SELECT property_address, created_at FROM transactions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Check Render Database
The Render-hosted Contract Conduit at:
https://mission-control-contract-conduit.onrender.com

- What DATABASE_URL is configured there?
- Is it the same database as Replit Production?

### 5. List All Users
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, created_at FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Are Randi's user account and preferences in the database?

### 6. Check User-Specific Data
For Randi (or other coordinators):
```sql
SELECT * FROM notification_settings WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%randi%' OR email LIKE '%spyglass%');
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_settings WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%randi%' OR email LIKE '%spyglass%');
```

## 📊 PROVIDE A REPORT WITH:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Number of databases | ? |
| Replit connects to | ? |
| Render connects to | ? |
| Same database? | Yes/No |
| Randi's transactions exist? | Yes/No |
| User settings exist? | Yes/No |
| Migration needed? | Yes/No/Partial |

## 🎯 WHAT RYAN WANTS
"Migrate Contract Conduit to Render without disturbing Randi's workflow"

This means:
- Randi's transactions must be accessible on Render
- Her user settings/preferences must persist
- No data loss during transition

Based on our earlier finding today (Replit connected to Production DB with 16 transactions), my hypothesis is:
ScenarioLikely?Migration Needed?Both Replit & Render use SAME databaseHighNo - just deploy codeSeparate databases with different dataLowYes - need data migration
